# Bones

This is the repository for my Bones & Booth discord bot within my [Bones server](https://discord.gg/epdZRszc9j). The bot is still in very early stages of development.

Bones is a show about a forensic anthropologist teaming up with an ex-sniper FBI agent and solve murders together.

So far there is a way for people to gamble bones, buy roles and set up their https://last.fm/ account to show people what music they like.
